## Final Project Planning
##### HRSS Lookback
* Each team member should complete the following template:

| | What went well | What could go better | What to do different
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | We communicated well, avoided merge conflicts and planned well and in advance| I don't think much could've gone better, i'll just be sure to check over my test names next tiem thats on me| I think continuing lots of communication and planning our testing method early. Will we populate the database as we go or clear after each test function?|
| Communication | Planning and talking about doing work/merging| Not much?| Planning testing like i said in planning|
| Execution | we did really well, checked work diligiently etc| checking work early!| I need to look over my test names|
